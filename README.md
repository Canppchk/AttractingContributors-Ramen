Welcome to the Favorite Headphones and Earphones project!

## Project Introduction
As part of our Software Engineering Class, we're exploring how to initiate open-source projects and encourage contributions from enthusiasts. This project focuses on compiling a list of favorite headphones and earphones.

### Goal
Our goal is to create a comprehensive repository where users can share their experiences and recommendations regarding headphones and earphones. Whether you're a music aficionado, audiophile, or simply enjoy great sound quality, we invite you to contribute to this collection.

### How to Contribute
